# MazeGame-2017
Java assignment basic programming

The game is a text-based adventure where the player has to navigate a maze with the goal of reaching the end. It implements the constraint that a player does not have default access to a map and will have to rely on generated movement options. To not leave the player completely blind, they come with the ability to look around their current location within the maze. Using this functionality they may find hidden objects and special kinds of walls (breakable, walls with doors, fake walls). In addition to this, a player may find and use a map (if one is included in the text file input that generates the maze).
